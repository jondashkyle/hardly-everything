There’s a problem with sites and apps today. It’s almost guaranteed your personal data is stored with the service, and not with you. This makes it difficult to use your data elsewhere, and almost impossible to leave or use with other services.

Since `v2`, Hardly Everything has supported saving your data locally with Dat when visiting in [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.org). Your data is written to your device, and you grant Hardly Everything permission to read and update it. Although functional, the interface hasn’t yet provided feedback about what form of storage is active, or a way to hot-swap between Dat archives.

This update introduces a new **Data storage** option in the panel, and does just that.

When visiting over HTTP your data is saved with [Localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), which stores your data locally, but isolated to the browser you’re visiting from. This avoids sending your data to a remote database, but also limits you from accessing it elsewhere, or sharing it with others should you choose. 

The updated **Data storage** option reflects your browser’s capabilities. *Local browser* indicates Dat is unavailable and Localstorage is used, however if Dat is available it reads *Select an archive*.

Selecting an archive by clicking the option allows you to either select an existing archive containing Hardly Everything data, or to create a new archive. This archive is then loaded whenever visiting Hardly Everything. You can also load another archive anytime you’d like, which is sort of like managing multiple libraries.

What was once the **Data** tab is now accessible by clicking *View*, containing options for exporting and importing your raw data. This is handy for manually backing up your data, or to transfer between environments. Soon Dat will be adding multi-writer, which will enable you to read/write to the same archive across devices. Until then, this will likely come in handy.

Clearly Hardly Everything takes a simple and experimental approach to user data. Although it’s possible to export your data from platforms like Facebook or Twitter, it doesn’t do much good when no other application interfaces with it. Instead, it’s important to change the defaults and begin cultivating a set of loose standards which facilitate user owned data and permissions based access across fungible tools.

Hopefully this update is useful for you, too!

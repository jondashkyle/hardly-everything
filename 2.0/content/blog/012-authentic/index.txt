Removing the Google Fonts dependency was one of the most important new features of v2. While providing a convenient API for embedding some of the best open source type, it’s speculated the traffic provides an entry point<sup>1</sup> into your site’s traffic through which Google can extract valuable data<sup>2</sup>.

Choosing the type was made easier thanks to helpful tools like [Raphaël Bastide](https://raphaelbastide.com/)’s [Use & Modify](https://usemodify.com/), but one which immediately came to mind was [Authentic Sans](https://authentic.website/#sans) by Authentic. Imagine the gratitude felt when Authentic donated Authentic Untitled to the selection of available typography, too!

Huge ups to the friends at [Authentic](https://authentic.website). Gratuitous type specimen below.

2. [Host webfonts on your own server](http://kernelpanik.net/host-webfonts-on-own-server/)

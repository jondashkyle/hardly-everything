If you navigate to your [Options](/panel/options) you’ll see something fresh—**Edit your custom CSS**. Clicking this new option will expand to display CSS you can modify to tweak your design beyond the capabilities provided by the interface.

All of the values are made available to you via CSS variables, which you can always revert back to by clicking **reset**. You can use handy CSS methods like `calc`, which is for doing simple mathematic operations on variables such as `spacing`.

Possibilities include setting a background image, or selecting any font installed on your local machine. For instance:

```
.design-container {
  font-family: "Suisse Intl Mono";
}
```

Hopefully this is useful making your feed even more personalized!
